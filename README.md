# HarvesterAI
A simple GUI tool to systematically extract data from PDFs to assist in meta-analysis and systematic reviews using AI.

The tool uses a structured set of questions, instructions, and example options to extract data from a large number of PDFs using AI.

The tool is free, but requires your own API key (i.e., the program is free, but you pay your own AI computing costs). API usage costs are approximately $0.70USD per 100 PDFs using the recommended DeepSeek model, or $5.00USD per 100 PDFs using OpenAI models.

Steps:
1. Create a folder of PDFs. It is recommended to use Zotero and export the library.
2. Make a API key and purchase credits. For example at https://platform.deepseek.com/
3. Fill in information about your PDF folder, Zotero library, questions, and output folder destinations.
4. Run a test run to see if the answers are satifsfactory, then either refine your questions and repeat, or continue.
5. Run the full extraction!
