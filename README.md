A simple GUI tool to systematically extract data from PDFs to assist in meta-analysis and systematic reviews using AI.

The tool uses a structured set of questions, instructions, and example options to extract data from a large number of PDFs using AI.

The tool is free, but requires your own API key (i.e., the program is free, but you pay your own AI computing costs). API usage costs are approximately $0.70USD per 100 PDFs using the recommended DeepSeek model, or $5.00USD per 100 PDFs using OpenAI models.

Before Using:
1. Do your title and abstract screening as you wish. For example using ASReview or Covidence.
2. Download your list of studies you wish to extract data from (e.g., for the purpose of assisted screening or for assisting in full text extraction) and find PDFs. I recommend using Zotero or Endnote.
3. Make a API key and purchase credits with the AI you wish to use. I use Deepseek as I have found it a good balance of cost and accuracy - https://platform.deepseek.com/  
Steps:
1. Export your Zotero or Endnote library with PDFs to a target folder and RIS formatting.
2. Open the program and fill in information about your PDF folder, Zotero library, questions, and output folder destinations.
3. Run a test run to see if the answers are satifsfactory, then either refine your questions and repeat, or continue.
4. Run the full extraction!
